mimms 3.2 released 2008-04-15
---------

  * Use SI units in progress bar, and native sizes in buffers.

  * Removed libmms.Stream.data; instead, Stream can just be iterated.

mimms 3.1 released 2008-04-06
---------

  * All implementation is refactored into libmimms. This makes it easier to
    use mimms from other python programs.

  * Compared to 3.0, this version is documented and commented much better.

  * User interface (progress reporting, error messages, etc) improvements.

mimms 3.0 released 2008-04-03
---------

  * Rewritten completely in python; most features work the same as they
    used to, but there are some differences. For example, ASX parsing
    from http URLs is not implemented (yet?) in this version.

  * Lots of bug fixes and new features. For example, resume is fully now
    implemented, timed downloading works better, progress indication is
    improved, etc.
